### Neargram for Android 7.0
Do you know that more than the 97% of the communication is lost in the messagging apps?
That is true as we can't exploit the power of nonverbal communication behind a screen.
For this reason, the aim of Neargram is to use the way the user types a message on Telegram to detect whether is feeling a positive, neutral or negative emotion.
